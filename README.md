# Randomness tests

This repository contains a test for verifying that a random number generator (RNG) is indeed providing
random numbers. Currently, only the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diehard_tests">Birthday Spacings Test</a>
is implemented, but more randomness tests might be implemented in the future.

The code is released by the Alexandra Institute under an MIT License.
